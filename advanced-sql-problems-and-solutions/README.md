### The code

All of the code is self contained in the virtual schema `master_class_2021_adv_sql`.

### Installation

Load the file `adv_sql-export.sql` into Data Virtuality Studio and execute the file. This will create the virtual schema, views, and stored procedures.

### Notes on running the examples

Some examples require tables to be created and values inserted into the table. Please review the PowerPoint file and the video for detailed information.
